## The Quest

"Greetings Traveler,  You have come at a most important time." Ok, enough of that.  Now that i'm on the [Aerogear](http://aerogear.org) team, i thought it would cool to show aerogear.js in action other than our really cool [TODO app](https://todo-aerogear.rhcloud.com/).

My Quest, er, i mean, what i want to do is use the aerogear.js library to connect and display some data from the World of Warcraft REST API.

## Look!!  Here Comes The Back Story

I used to play WoW.  I'd say it suck away 2 years of my life.  It was fun,  i was a bit of an alt-aholic.  For the most part my main character was a rogue named Lincolnhawk,  but toward the end i switched to my warlock, Johnmatrix.

It been 2 years since i've played, i stopped when my daugther was born.  I knew that there was an API that you could hook into that would display character info and such, but i never had a good reason to really try and play with it until now.

## Character Selection Screen

Let's define what we are really going to do here:

1. Use an Aerogear.js pipeline to connect to the WoW REST API
2. Use the Aerogear.js data-manager to store our data
3. Display it
4. Make it much prettier
5. Create Cordova App
6. Possible native iOS version (using Aerogear iOS)
7. Possible native Android version(using Aerogear Android)

## Early Levels

Now that we've defined what we are going to do, lets start questing,  i mean coding.  It'll probably be good to start with checking out the docs for [aerogear.js](http://aerogear.org) and the [WoW API](http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/) .


### Next up

I finish some early level quests and think about what lies in store for the next zones
