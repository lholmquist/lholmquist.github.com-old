##Last Time

[Previously]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ page.previous.url }}), We started to create a Pure DPS class.  Thats code for using the Native AeroGear iOS libraries.

We created a new character,  and got through the starting zone and took a ride on the tram.  Again, this is code for using the AeroGear iOS pipeline to connect to the REST endpoints.

Our previous character could also show detail,  so i started over and recreated the character to use some of the tools in xcode for help( storyboarding ).  Since this is a AeroGear post and not an iOS programming guide, we should be all good.

This is a real short post,  notice it's part 7.5 not part 8,  It's just to show that code is new.


##Next Time

Back to Westfall( Using the Aerogear Datamanager ).

Here is the new code: [repo](https://github.com/lholmquist/WoWAerogeariOS)
