Hot on the heels of the 1.3.0 release of AeroGear.js, comes the 1.3.1 release.

This wasn't a big patch release, but it includes a few cool new options to DataManager

## Preferred Fallback

With the 1.3.0 release, we introduced IndexedDB and WebSQL adapters for DataManager, as well as a way to fallback if an adapter was not supported.

With this release, we've added a `preferred` option to DataManager, where you can specify the adapters and the order in which they fallback

So now if we try and create a WebSQL store and it is not supported, we will only fallback to a Memory store

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var dm = AeroGear.DataManager([
    {
        name: "createTest21",
        type: "WebSQL",
        settings: { preferred: [ "Memory" ] }
    }
]).stores;
{% endhighlight %}

## No Fallback

Another option that was added is `fallback`. It will always default to `true`, but if you do not want to fallback if an adapter is not present then set this option to `false`

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var dm = AeroGear.DataManager([
    {
        name: "createTest32",
        type: "WebSQL",
        settings: {
            fallback: false
        }
    }
]).stores;
{% endhighlight %}

## Auto Connect

This next option is a really cool one!!

Since the new IndexedDB and WebSQL adapters need to be opened first, you need to use a callback/promise to handle that, but the Memory and SessionLocal adapters don't need to be.

Sure we added `open` methods to those other adapters, but it would have been nice if we could just start calling read or save or whatever.

The new `auto` option now allows for that.

When set to `true`, you do not have to worry about "opening" the stores before calling `read`, for example.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
dm.add({
    name: "test1",
    type: "IndexedDB",
    settings: {
        auto: true
    }
});

dm.stores.test1.save( data, {
    success: function( data ) { ... }
);
{% endhighlight %}
