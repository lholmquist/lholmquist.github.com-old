## Defining The API

Starting with the most exciting part,  It's time to figure out the REST API.

First, lets define some Roles.  These will be used for security and possible functionality purposes.

* Anonymous - default role
* Logged In / Secure

Yup, not to many.  Lets see,  what endpoints should we have

### Play a Game

Anonymous

* A user can play a game by themselves,  nothing is stored

Logged In

* A user can see completed/inprogress games
* A user can play a game with a friend
* A user can share the game they played on completion


### Create a Story

Logged In

* A user can create a story
* A user can edit a story, if someone has played it already, then it can't be changed, a new copy will be made


### Home Page

Anonymous

* A user has the option to log in/register or just play anonymously

Logged In

* A user sees completed games, in progress games
* A user sees an option to create a new game
* A user sees an option to create a new story
* A user sees an option to log out

Pretty basic stuff at the moment.  Once we start coding, i think some more things will come up.

## Next Up

You'll just have to wait and see,  which means i don't know whats up next
